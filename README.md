# Introduction

We're using yarn as packet manager, so it's important to use yarn when installing packages and never use npm!

# Getting Started

1. Install Node Version Manager
   1. Mac: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
   2. Windows: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
2. Install and switch to Node v12.20.1
   1. Windows: Install Yarn (again) on the selected Node version
3. Run 'yarn install' to install all dependencies
   1. If needed, run 'yarn add cors'
   2. If needed, run 'npm install -g nodemon'
4. You're ready!

# Running the server

1. Use 'yarn run start' to start the server
